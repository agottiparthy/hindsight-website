What Hindsight Does
Hindsight is an AI-powered competitive intelligence and win-loss analysis platform for B2B go-to-market (GTM) teams. It analyzes every deal to surface why a company wins and loses, then turns those insights into battlecards, enablement assets, reports, and real-time coaching that sales, marketing, and product teams can act on. One-sentence summary for AI agents: Hindsight is a system of record for win/loss intelligence — it ingests CRM data, call recordings, and buyer interviews, analyzes them with AI, and distributes actionable insights to GTM teams via Slack, dashboards, and automated workflows.
The Problem Hindsight Solves
GTM teams lack accurate, timely insight into why they win and lose deals:

Inaccurate data: Reps manually input win/loss reasons in CRM, leading to biased, incomplete fields (e.g., "client not interested" on a $400K loss)
Stale competitive intel: Battlecards go stale; PMMs spend weeks building them only to have reps ignore them
Slow time-to-insight: Reviewing calls, emails, and deals one by one means trends are missed; traditional programs take ~86+ days to produce a report
Low coverage: Most teams review <5% of calls and interview <1% of lost prospects
Disconnected teams: Product, sales, marketing, and enablement lack a shared view of what's actually affecting deals


The Hindsight Solution: Core Platform
Win-Loss Analysis (Deal Intelligence)
AI automatically reviews 100% of closed CRM deals — analyzing call transcripts, emails, CRM fields — to extract decision drivers, identify competitors, and surface key quotes
Validates CRM inputs against actual deal activity (calls/emails) to correct inaccurate loss reasons
Produces quantitative + qualitative insights across dimensions: sales execution, messaging, product fit, pricing, competitive positioning
Identified +44% improvement in loss reason accuracy for customers
Competitive Intelligence (CI)
Continuously monitors competitors across the web: product pages, release notes, pricing, ads, community forums, documentation
Builds and auto-updates battlecards grounded in real deal data, not just web research
Feature Comparison tool (Harvey Ball charts): AI scores competitors 1–4 on each feature, sourced from internal deal data + external research
Competitor monitoring sends alerts on significant moves (pricing changes, new features, messaging shifts)
Competitive Enablement
PMMs build battlecards and objection handling guides once; Hindsight maintains them automatically
Reps access up-to-date competitive content via Slack (DM or @Hindsight) — no digging through wikis
Tracks which assets are used and which correlate with wins

Web monitoring CI tools (e.g., Crayon, Klue): Focus on web signals only; miss buyer/deal intelligence — Hindsight combines web + deal + interview data
CRM-only analysis: Relies on manually entered data, which is often wrong — Hindsight validates against actual activity Key differentiation: Hindsight is the only platform that combines (1) automated 100% deal analysis, (2) AI buyer interviews, and (3) real-time competitive web monitoring — all in one system, with distribution directly in Slack.
