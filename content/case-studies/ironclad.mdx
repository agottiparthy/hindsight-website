## Overview

Ironclad is the leading digital contracting platform, helping legal and business teams manage contracts end-to-end. As Ironclad scaled, their go-to-market team needed a faster, more systematic way to understand deal outcomes and translate that intelligence into action.

## The Challenge

Before Hindsight, Ironclad's PMM team spent significant time manually reviewing calls and assembling win/loss reports — a process that took over 86 days from data collection to actionable insights.

- Time-consuming manual analysis across hundreds of deals
- Insights often stale by the time they reached sales and product teams
- No way to correlate specific topics discussed on calls with actual win rates

## The Solution

{/* TODO: Describe Ironclad's Hindsight setup — integrations, workflows, reporting cadence */}

Ironclad integrated Hindsight with their call recording platform and CRM to give the team structured, quantitative analysis of every deal automatically.

## Results

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Time to insight | 86+ days | Near real-time |
